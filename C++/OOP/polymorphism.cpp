POLYMORPHISM : 
1. This just like one element with differnt forms or use
2. There are two types : 
    --> A. CompileTime Polyorphism => Here we know which Funcation is being gonna called (Also called Early-Binding)
        --> a. Funcation Overloading
        --> b. Operator Overloading
    --> B. RunTime Polyorphism => Here after the program is runned we come to know which funcation is called
        --> a. Virtual Funcation
